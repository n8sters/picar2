# Raspberry Pi controlled car!
This project was created by Nathaniel Powers, as part of a Computer Science 5 final project. The "extra_tools" libraries are courtesy of Adafruit, and help make sure the motors work safely. 
Communication between the client server and RPi is done throught PuTTY, a command-line connectivity tool. Wiring can be done however the user desires, and the pins I are marked in all files.
